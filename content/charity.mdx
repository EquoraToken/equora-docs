# Charity Info

## Charity Wallet Tracking

To ensure transparency and accountability, we have provided the charity wallet address for EquoraToken (EQR) donations:

- **Wallet Address**: [0x25282D4e4055cdb2D43f4395718b1c61E6C5676c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25282D4e4055cdb2D43f4395718b1c61E6C5676c)

## Charity Focus

The focus will be on getting funds to orphanages in the world's lowest economic areas. We believe that every child deserves a chance to thrive, and we are committed to supporting these children in need. These children did not choose their circumstances, and we aim to provide them with the resources they need to build a brighter future.

## Donation Process

The charity wallet will receive 4% of all transactions made with EquoraToken and at the end of the calendar year the funds will be distributed to the designated orphanages. We will provide updates on the donation process and the impact of your contributions. The transactions will be transparent and available for review on the blockchain.
